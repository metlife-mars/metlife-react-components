# Metlife React Components

[![Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/press/blob/master/badges/storybook.svg)](https://metlife-mars.github.io/metlife-react-components)

A list of React Components based on the MetLife ux design guidelines.

MetLife us team has created a set of self contained web elements (button, dropdown, table, icons...) using html and css. So here we will create React component versions of the web elements.

Each component will be tested and documented using the storybook development environment.

Each completed component should be listed below with a link to its storybook documentation.
